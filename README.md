# Tor Prop279 Provider for Namecoin

`ncprop279` acts as a bridge between Tor Prop279 clients and Namecoin; it can be used for Namecoin naming in Tor.  Unlike `dns-prop279`, it does not use the DNS wire protocol.  This reduces attack surface and binary size, but prevents delegation from Namecoin to DNS via NS/DS records.

## Usage

You need [StemNS](https://github.com/namecoin/StemNS) or [TorNS](https://github.com/meejah/TorNS) in order to use `ncprop279`.  You also need a Namecoin lookup client such as Namecoin Core, ConsensusJ-Namecoin, or Electrum-NMC.  Your StemNS/TorNS services configuration might look like this:

~~~
_service_to_command = {
    "bit.onion": ['/path/to/ncprop279'],
    "bit": ['/path/to/ncprop279'],
}
~~~

## Security Notes

* `ncprop279` hasn't been carefully checked for proxy leaks.
* Using `ncprop279` will make you stand out from other Tor users.
* Stream isolation for streams opened by applications (e.g. Tor Browser) should work fine.
* Stream isolation metadata is passed through to the Namecoin lookup client, so any network traffic produced as a result of your lookups (e.g. traffic between Electrum-NMC and ElectrumX) will be stream-isolated.
* Lookups are cached; the cache is stream-isolated.
* This whole thing is highly experimental!  Please test it and give feedback, but **don't rely on it behaving correctly**.
